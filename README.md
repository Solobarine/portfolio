# HI There,

This is my Portfolio Website showcasing my skills as a Full Stack Developer and my Top Projects.

## Technology Used

- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It enables developers to write more reliable and maintainable code by catching errors during development and providing advanced tooling support for features like autocompletion and refactoring.
- **ReactJS:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to build interactive and dynamic web applications.
- **TailwindCSS:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed, low-level utility classes. It allows developers to rapidly build responsive and customizable user interfaces by composing styles directly in the HTML markup, offering a highly efficient and flexible approach to styling web applications.
